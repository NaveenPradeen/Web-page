                        Iâ€™m a passionate industrial technology professional specializing in Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). With hands-on experience in digitalizing shop floors and integrating OT (Operational Technology) with IT systems, I help manufacturers improve productivity, traceability, and real-time decision-making. My journey began with a strong foundation in automation and control systems, which naturally evolved into MES deployment and IIoT integrations. I have worked on real-time data acquisition, system architecture design, and edge-to-cloud solutions that empower smart manufacturing.
